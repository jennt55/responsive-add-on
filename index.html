What makes the fantasy genre so appealing?
      </h2>
      <p class="mainParagraph">
        Fantasy literature offers the reader much of what general fiction offers — escape and adventure — but it goes far beyond the familiar realm of belief. It allows us to enter a world of "contrasts and opposites", to break away from the entrapment of realism.

              The Lord of the Rings Trilogy
            </h4><p>
The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel by the English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.

              A Game of Thrones
            </h4><p>
A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin. He began writing the first volume, A Game of Thrones, in 1991, publishing it in 1996. The novels are set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos. The story unfolds through a rotating set of subjective points of view, the success or survival of any one of which is never assured. Each chapter is told from a limited third-person perspective, drawn from a group of characters that grows from nine in the first novel to 31 by the fifth.</p>
